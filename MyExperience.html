<h1>My Experience in Woxsen</h1>
<p>Hello i am Sabahat Shaik, student of B. Tech second year at Woxsen University. At Woxsen, the curriculum is designed in a way that it promotes research and innovation. This helps us to understand the requirements of the industry. Here the classes are not just theoretical, we learn the concepts and the get hands on experience too.
Apart from academics, the campus life has been great. There are also many extra curricular activities and events to participate in. Truth to be told, so far my experience at woxsen university has been a an absolute rollercoaster, but in a fun way. </p>
